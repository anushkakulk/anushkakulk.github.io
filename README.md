this is my portfolio/personal website. this was mainly me fiddling with react lol.

## stack ##
A classic - built with react/next.js(framework) and tailwind css styling

## current features/functionality ##
- Spotify Web API integration to display my profile's metadata
- fully responsive 
- clean aesthetic (palette used: https://coolors.co/faf3dd-c8d5b9-8fc0a9-68b0ab-696d7d)
- smooth scrolling
- lazy loading

## future improvements/ideas ##
- switch all sections to be individual pages instead of one long page with scrolling (aesthetic choice akjsdfbk)
- possible blender/three.js animations to add some spice
- typing animation (? is it kitschy...)
